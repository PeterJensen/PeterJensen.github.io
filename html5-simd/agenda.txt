  Prototypes
    - Chrome
    - Firefox (interpreter support)
    - Crosswalk

  Application Domains
    - Games
      - vector matrix operations, e.g. glMatrix.js (for webGL)
      - physics
      - Box2D
    - Image processing
    - Signal/audio processing
    - Fluid dynamics

  Performance results

  How to use Today!
    - Intel XDK with Crosswalk

  Device Demo
    - Videocast

  Going forward
    - Finish Firefox prototype
    - ES7 proposal TC39 presentation (July meeting)
    - Short Vector Math Library (sin/cos/exp/pow etc)
    - Higher level abstractions API's written in JS
